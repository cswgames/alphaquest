# Origins

For a bit of background, 'Alpha Quest' was the name of our first big game some friends and I were making when
we were first learning how to write programs. It was planned to be a text based RPG with an open world. But it
was to complex for us at that time so we slowly dropped the project. We have gone our own ways in programming
now, but I decided for memories sake I would go ahead and finish the first world
we created together.
