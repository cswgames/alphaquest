So, The battle engine is being.... harder than I expected.
I may need to write a new engine instead of using the old one.
Certain pieces just don't fit in... I also need to work on the town and shops.

Everything is up on github now! I finally set up git on my localhost. 
I've been pretty lazy on this project, more info will be uploaded soon.

Save and Load script are done. I decided that having the two
functions in separate files was a good idea. Easier to trace an error.
I don't really care about the number of imports. It's written to save
just the Player stats, but I mean nobody will need to save before that
comes around anyways.
