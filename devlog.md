So, The battle engine is being.... harder than I expected.
I may need to write a new engine instead of using the old one.
Certain pieces just don't fit in... I also need to work on the town and shops.

Everything is up on github now! I finally set up git on my localhost. 
I've been pretty lazy on this project, more info will be uploaded soon.

Save and Load script are done. I decided that having the two
functions in separate files was a good idea. Easier to trace an error.
I don't really care about the number of imports. It's written to save
just the Player stats, but I mean nobody will need to save before that
comes around anyways.

Battle engine started working, I realized that the error was that no
enemy was defined lol. I'm getting pissed off with python's
tabbing system though. It's very buggy in my opinion, 70% of my
errors is just Vim being confused if it is 4 spaces or a tab. Why
can't it just use curly brackets like other languages? Whatever,
I shouldn't rant here. Name feature for the player was added too.
